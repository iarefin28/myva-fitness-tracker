// TODO: Support Custom Exercises
// ------------------------------
// Context:
// - Currently, exercises are hardcoded in EXERCISES_DB
// - Users cannot add their own workouts dynamically
//
//  Goal:
// - Allow users to add a new exercise name + type
// - Store this data locally (AsyncStorage or SQLite)
// - Merge with default exercises on app load
//
// Notes:
// - Watch for duplicate exercise names
// - Consider tagging custom exercises with isCustom = true

  //and give them flexibility on what they want to add. 
  //Maybe allow them to pick what muscle group is gonna be hit to dynamically render "single arm" tag vs "single leg"
